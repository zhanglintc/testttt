# Problem:
# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

# Picture see: https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/

# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement,
# where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

# For example,
# There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

# [
#  [".Q..",  // Solution 1
#   "...Q",
#   "Q...",
#   "..Q."],

#  ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
#   "Q...",
#   "...Q",
#   ".Q.."]
# ]

class Solution:
    # @return a list of lists of string
    def solveNQueens(self, n):
