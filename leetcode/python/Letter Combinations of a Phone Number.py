# Or the sketch by zhanglin:
# ----------------------- #
#  1       2       3      #
# ($_$)   (abc)   (def)   #
#                         #
#  4       5       6      #
# (ghi)   (jkl)   (mno)   #
#                         #
#  7       8       9      #
# (pqrs)  (tuv)   (wxyz)  #
# ----------------------- #

# Input:Digit string "23"
# Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"].

# Note:
# Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

class Solution:
    # @return a list of strings, [s1, s2]
    def letterCombinations(self, digits):
        pass
