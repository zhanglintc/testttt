# for leetcode problems

# Problem:
# Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string bydeleting some (can be none)
# of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
# (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

# Here is an example:
# S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"

# Return 3.

class Solution:
    # @return an integer
    def numDistinct(self, S, T):
        pass
