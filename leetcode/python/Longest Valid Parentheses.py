# Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

# For "(()", the longest valid parentheses substring is "()", which has length = 2.

# Another example is ")()())", where the longest valid parentheses substring is "()()", which has length = 4.

class Solution:
    # @param s, a string
    # @return an integer
    def longestValidParentheses(self, s):
        pass
