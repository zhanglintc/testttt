# Palindrome Partitioning II
# for leetcode problems
# 2014.12.03 by zhanglin

# Problem:
# Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.

# Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.

# For example, given s = "aab",
# Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.

class Solution:
    # @param s, a string
    # @return an integer
    def minCut(self, s):
        pass
